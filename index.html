  Brief Description of Goal of Code:
  Be able to have a user submit a picture that would be processed in 2 canvases, one displaying the original picture and one showing 
  the picture that had all the red and green (RB of RGB removed) to display only blue tints.
 
  Known Issues:
  The cropping of the picture, because of set height and width of the canvas, is a bit "squashed" when a vertical photo is uploaded from a 
  mobile iOS device. On PC it works fine with the picture scaling and cropping perfectly, just not on mobile.
